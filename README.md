## 📌 Description

QuickDeliver_BF is a console-based delivery management application built in Python.
It allows a transport company to register clients and couriers, create and track deliveries,
calculate shipping fees automatically, and generate activity reports — all saved to local
text files for data persistence.

The application runs entirely in the terminal. The user navigates through a numbered menu
and interacts by typing numbers and text.
